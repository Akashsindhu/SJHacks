### Inspiration
Pi is the most recognized mathematical constant in the world. Scholars often consider Pi the most important and intriguing number in all of mathematics. We tried to explore the power of Google Could Platform by calculating 10 million decimal places of Pi.

### What it does
Pi has many facts associated with it, one of which is we can get the location of our birth date in those 10 million places.(Pi is way to arbitrary, you can find any string)

### Challenges we ran into
Setting up Compute Engine, to be precise - connecting from the 3rd party applications to the engine. Installing MPIR package. (yasm, M4) Addressing the range - millions digits.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to implement the whole idea.

### What we learned
Dealing with large numbers using MPIR library and using KMP search algorithm to search a particular sub-string in large string in O(n) complexity.

### What's next for PiHack
Great UI, great insights into Pi.

### Built With
C++, Multiple Precision Integers and Rationals Library, Google Compute Engine
